# titanic-analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset to uncover patterns in passenger survival. I used Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib to clean the data, analyze trends, and visualize key insights.

## 📊 Objectives
- Clean missing data (age, embarked)
- Analyze survival rates by gender, class, and age group
- Visualize important trends using graphs
- Practice real-world data science workflow

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Females** had the highest survival rate (~74%)
- **1st Class passengers** survived more than 2nd or 3rd
- **Teenage males** had surprisingly higher survival than other male groups
- Children and seniors were more likely to survive than adults
- Missing age values were filled with the dataset’s average age

## 📁 File
- `titanic.ipynb`: The complete notebook with code, analysis, and visualizations.

## 🚀 What's Next
- Build a logistic regression model to predict survival
- Try using Streamlit to create an interactive Titanic dashboard
